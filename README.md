# gRPC-TS-Example

This repository provides an example implementation of **gRPC** using **TypeScript**. It is part of the **gRPC Introduction** blog series. For a detailed explanation, please visit the blog:

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

1. **Define** gRPC services and messages using Protocol Buffers.
2. **Generate** TypeScript interfaces and gRPC code using `ts-proto`.
3. Implement all four types of **gRPC calls**:
   - **Unary RPC**
   - **Server-Side Streaming RPC**
   - **Client-Side Streaming RPC**
   - **Bidirectional Streaming RPC**

The example includes both **server-side** and **client-side** implementations for each type of gRPC call.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** or **Yarn**
- **protoc** (Protocol Buffers Compiler)

---

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qstommyshu/grpc-ts-example.git
   cd grpc-ts-example
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use Yarn to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Generate TypeScript Code from Protobuf**:

   Run the following script to generate TypeScript interfaces and gRPC code:

   ```bash
   yarn run proto:build
   ```

4. **Run the gRPC Server**:

   Start the gRPC server by running:

   ```bash
   yarn run server

   ```

5. **Test gRPC Clients**:

   Use the following commands to test each RPC example:

   - Unary RPC:

   ```bash
   yarn run client:unary
   ```

   - Server-Side Streaming RPC:

   ```bash
   yarn run client:server-stream
   ```

   - Client-Side Streaming RPC:

   ```bash
   yarn run client:client-stream
   ```

   - Bidirectional Streaming RPC:

   ```bash
   yarn run client:bidirectional

   ```

## RPC Examples

Here is an overview of the four types of gRPC calls implemented in this example:

1. Unary RPC:

   - The client sends a single request and receives a single response.
   - Example: A client sends a message, and the server responds with a confirmation.

2. Server-Side Streaming RPC:

   - The client sends a single request, and the server streams multiple responses.
   - Example: A client requests a large file, and the server streams the file in chunks.

3. Client-Side Streaming RPC:

   - The client streams multiple requests, and the server sends a single response after processing.
   - Example: A client uploads file chunks to the server, and the server responds with a success status.

4. Bidirectional Streaming RPC:
   - Both the client and server stream data to each other simultaneously.
   - Example: A chat application where both sides send and receive messages in real time.
